				<h2>About</h2>
				<article>
					<h3>A little bit about me</h3>
					<p>
						I'm a third year Web Development student at Manchester Metropolitan University. I was born and raised in Stones Green, a little village in Essex (before you ask - no we are not all like the people off 'The Only Way is Essex'). I am 21 years old and was born on the 3rd of October 1994.

					<h3>My Course and Career Aspirations</h3>
					<p>
						The course I am following is Web Development, I hope to gain valuable web development and group working skills as I progress through university. The career I would like to follow, following the completion of my course may consist of either freelance work, or depending on the circumstances, working for a Web Design / Development Agency. 
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Previous Education </h3>
					<p>
						Before coming to MMU, I was educated in Tendring Technology College, where I studied Media and IT. I chose to study these two courses because I am interested in capabilities of a computer; so studying two very computer based courses was the best option for me to follow.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
					<p>
						My interests and hobbies consist of coding/programming, music, playing games on my Xbox or PC, socialising with friends and mechanics (I own and maintain my car I.E. I service it, and attempt to fix any problems it may have.)

					<h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
					<img src="images/gridset.jpg" alt="My gridset report" />
					<p>“The use of mobile devices to surf the web is growing at an astronomical pace, but unfortunately much of the web isn't optimized for those mobile devices. Mobile devices are often constrained by display size and require a different approach to how content is laid out on screen.” (<a title="Google Developers website" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/fundamentals/?hl=en">Google Developers</a>, 2014) Ever since responsive design first appeared, Google have been dominating the market with which standards to comply to, this is mainly down to it being the largest internet search engine in existence, which means that they can dictate what websites they prioritise and penalise due to certain coding methods.</p>
					<p>A good example of how they’ve abused this power is their recent announcement. “<a title="Mobilegeddon" href="http://searchengineland.com/mobilegeddon-beginning-not-ending-220512">Mobilegeddon</a>” is a new Google standard that dictates that any website that isn't responsive, is penalised in search rankings for mobile devices; therefore, it’s safe to say that in this day and age responsive design is one of the base fundamentals of website design.</p>
					<div class="div50width" style="float:left;"><img src="images/blogs/gridset1.jpg" class="blogimgs" alt="Gridset Statistics" /></div>
					<div class="div50width" style="float:left;"><img src="images/blogs/gridset2.jpg" class="blogimgs" alt="Gridset Statistics" /></div>
					<p>As a responsive website is fundamental, companies such as Gridset offer a responsive grid system to allow people to achieve this. Gridset conducted their own survey that seems to add weight to the claim off of Google, out of the 1014 people that answered their survey, “Front-end developers (33%) grew the most over the last year with an increase of 10%, representing the largest change amongst the roles, and the only group reported in 2013 that increased in 2014.” (<a title="Gridset's Website" href="2014.report.gridsetapp.com">Gridset</a>, 2015) with these figures in mind, it’s safe to say that Gridset aren’t the only people to realise the importance of responsive design. I have absolutely no doubt that these statistics provide a true picture, the reason I say this is because I am also one of those people who has switched from another role in to the front end developer role, more specifically, I switched from wanting to be a developer to being a hybrid of developer and designer.</p>
					<p>Responsive design was first featured in 2001 by <a title="Audi website" href="http://audi.com">Audi.com</a>, in which they created a website that responded to the browser's width. This revolutionised how websites are made and opened a whole new door in to the development world. By early 2009 to 2010 CSS3 media queries had been defined and were almost ready to be integrated in to the web development world, by 2011 the first guide was made on how to put these media queries in to practice. This then became an actual <a title="W3C Recommended Standards" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">W3C recommended standard</a> on the 19th of June 2012, shortly after all browsers had integrated compatibility with said code.</p>
					<p>14 years later, we now have tools that aid the creation of responsive websites; namely we have Gridset (obviously) and frameworks such as Bootstrap and foundation 5 which both have browser-width responsive grid layouts. With said tools you can now create responsive websites without even touching the cascading style sheet (CSS), for example, Bootstrap imports its own predefined CSS which already has the device breakpoints coded. Although the CSS for Bootstrap has already been defined it doesn’t mean that you aren’t able to edit it, this can be done by simply overriding the current CSS. Although I no longer use HTML/CSS frameworks when coding websites I have found that they have taught me a large array of skills, for example, through the use of Bootstrap I’ve learnt how to use CSS3 media queries, build basic grid layouts and its also given me a good overview of CSS in general.</p>
					<div class="div50width" style="float:left;"><img src="images/blogs/bootstraplogo.png" class="blogimgs" alt="Bootstrap Logo" /></div>
					<div class="div50width" style="float:left;"><img src="images/blogs/foundation5.jpg" class="blogimgs" alt="Foundation 5 Logo" /></div>
					<p>in conclusion of my findings I believe that responsive design is the ONLY way forward, and although companies do develop tools to help us create responsive websites, they can’t keep up with how fast the industry is growing, which therefore leads me to conclude that responsive design is best kept to the basics (being HTML5 and CSS3), by doing this you’ll save yourself a lot of time and effort that you might of invested in to development tools.</p>

					<h2>Building my Portfolio</h2>
					<p>Building my Portfolio was never going to be an easy task, however, in today’s world there are tools out there which simplify and shorten the time taken to create a fully responsive website. In this blog post I'll go into the exact route that I used to research, design, build and launch my portfolio.</p>
					<p>From start to finish my portfolio took me 2 full days of coding, followed by a few additional hours for those final tweaks. Although this doesn’t sound like a realistic time scale, I already had a portfolio prior to this which had the basic design cracked along with the typical functionality of my current website, this gave me a good head start with the creation as I knew exactly what I wanted my website to look like and what other features I needed to add. </p>
					<img src="images/blogs/existingwebsite1.jpg" alt="My old Website, Coded in Bootstrap" />
					<p>Originally my portfolio was created using Bootstrap;  a grid based “HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web” (<a title="Bootstrap" href="Getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, 2015) solely because it was the easy method to create a fully responsive website. However, after just a few months of coding using only HTML and CSS I felt that Bootstrap was a little restrictive in the design field which led to the conclusion that I'll recode my website removing the Bootstrap element of it and replacing it with just HTML5, CSS and some custom made JavaScript’s that I've made.</p>
					<p>After spending a few hours recoding my website to just HTML5 and CSS I then started to work on the more practical functions that HTML5 has to offer. To start with I updated my grid layout from the old method which used multiple media queries to make them drop below one another as the screen gets smaller, to HTML5’s new method Flex box. I chose to do this because Flex Box was “designed to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height” (<a title="Css-tricks" href="Css-tricks.com">Css-tricks</a>, 2015) which meant that I could shorten the amount of CSS used. By doing this it has enhanced the user experience with its overall smoother responsive layout.</p>
					<div class="div50width" style="float:left;"><img src="images/blogs/flexbox.jpg" class="blogimgs" alt="Intro to Flexbox" /></div>
					<div class="div50width" style="float:left;"><img src="images/blogs/flexbox2.jpg" class="blogimgs" alt="Where I've used Flexbox" /></div>
					<p>Second to finishing the Flex box method I then had to start on creating a responsive navigation bar for my portfolio as the navigation prior to this was a Bootstrap template. Now having had a bit of experience with using media queries and Javascript I decided to put my knowledge to the test which resulted in my first attempt; having two separate menu’s, one for the desktop and one for the mobile, then through the use of  media queries I hid the desktop navigation bar and showed the mobile navigation bar. This was okay for a while but after doing further research this method turned out to have a big restraint; if the user was using a screen reader it would display duplicate links, which would result in being penalised for accessibility. </p>
					<img src="images/blogs/nav.jpg" class="blogimgs" alt="A picture showing my responsive navigation" />
					<p>With this in mind I then set out to remove the duplicate menu and only have one set of links. To do this was quite a task, as although I could just switch styles using media queries, I also wanted to include a Jquery script that switched styles when scrolling past a certain point. This was where it started to get complicated as I had to have it switch styles when 1. The width was below 768px and 2. when the user scrolls past a certain point. After searching how to do this on Google one of the first results that turned up was a link to Stackoverflow; a huge online forum where you can ask people questions about how to do a certain piece of code. It was here where I found out the code required and from there it was a matter of trial and error until I got it right.</p>
					<p>The next thing on my to do list was to look into CSS3 transitions in order to add a bit of user interaction and to keep the user more interested in my website. My first port of call was to search it up on Google, which quickly took me to the CSS-Tricks website which gave me an overview on how to add a transition, then I just went to town with adding little transitions on hover to certain elements of my website.</p>
					<div class="div50width" style="float:left;"><img src="images/blogs/hover1.jpg" style="max-width:273px;" class="blogimgs" alt="An element without hover" /></div>
					<div class="div50width" style="float:left;"><img src="images/blogs/hover2.jpg" style="max-width:273px;" class="blogimgs" alt="An element with hover" /></div>
					<p>This just left one more element that I had to add; the PHP contact form. This was a relatively easy one as all I had to do was add a contact form that I’ve made in the past and just restyle it to match my portfolio’s design.</p>
					<p>This just left one last thing to do, launch the website on to the internet, for the world to see. Again this was relatively easy for me as I’ve had a lot of past experience with hosting websites, which meant that I knew exactly what needed to be done to host it. To summarise it in a sentence; I signed up to <a title="34sp hosting" href="34SP.com">34SP.com</a> using the MMU promo code, then I went on their web FTP and uploaded the website straight to their servers. As my domain name was already added through the sign up I had no need to switch the name servers or make any additional changes.</p>

					<h2>Amending My Portfolio</h2>
					<p>In light of the feedback I received for my portfolio, I have amended several areas of interest that my portfolio has to offer. </p>
					<p>The first thing I adapted is the description and title of my website. This was altered because my description exceeded the maximum character count by 200 characters (the maximum is 150 - 160), and my title included the abbreviation of Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) and so that also had to be altered to its full name.</p>
					<p>The second thing to be altered was how the exit button of each blog post was to be displayed. Prior to the update, the exit button cut off 40 pixels to the right of each blog post, I’ve now updated this so that it no longer cuts off any pixels from the sides, it instead is floated in the top right corner and only cuts 40 pixels off the top of each post.</p>
					<h3>Before</h3>
					<img src="images/blogs/blog3-before1.png" alt="Before the blog close button amendment" />
					<h3>After</h3>
					<img src="images/blogs/blog3-after1.png" alt="After the blog close button amendment" />
					<p>The next thing on my list to update was the form accessibility. This is because I used placeholder text to display the name of each entry field rather than the fully accessible option; form labels. This was a simple change and has now allowed my blog to be accessible to users with screen readers.</p>
					<h3>Before</h3>
					<img src="images/blogs/blog3-before2.png" alt="Before the form accessibility amendment" />
					<h3>After</h3>
					<img src="images/blogs/blog3-after2.png" alt="After the form accessibility amendment" />
					<p>My next amendment was more of an improvement rather than a correction. The ‘My Work’ section of my website contained direct links to work that I had created, but provided no explanation of what I had done to make that work mine. So as a result of this I added a description of each work piece highlighting what my efforts in the work were. This should also help with the SEO of my website.</p>
					<p>Once all the writing aspects of my website had been completed, I then went on to read through it all and make any grammatical changes that where necessary. This adds a professional value to my portfolio and can make all the difference between being contacted and not being contacted by a potential employer.</p>
					<p>Other little things that have been altered are how my CV was highlighted, this is because it only appeared in the contact section of my website, which led a few people astray when I asked them to find it (It’s now also been added to the skills section of my website). Finally I also updated some of the alternative text as it seems that some of it was mismatched.</p>
					<p>This left just one more thing to do; validate my code to make sure it has no problems and then make any alterations to the code where necessary. In reference to this, my code did in fact pass first time and so no additional alterations were made.</p>
